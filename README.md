making a simple recipes websites using what I have learned so far

6/24/25
So far I'm on my way to completing this project, but there is still more to do. So far I've maid the homepage as well as the main 3 recipe pages. But I still have to finish the recipe pages, and I could probably do a little bit of styling to the pages, but I will save that for the css portion later on. 

The one thinkg I should definetly work on is creating better commits. The one problem I realised is that im commiting all files in 1 go, which in hindsight isnt a good idea, because not all files are going to be connected, so its better to commit multiple times so that the history of the projects is a lot easier to understand.

Making a simple recipes websites using the basic knowledge of html that I have learned so far.
The main page will contain lists of recipes that will contain links to the page of that particular recipe.
